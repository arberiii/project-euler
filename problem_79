To solve this problem use pen and paper:

When examining all possible digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9), we observe a pattern. 
Digit 7 consistently appears first, while digit 0 consistently appears last.
Digit 3 is always found before or immediately after 7. 
Following 3, we find digit 1. 
Digit 9 consistently appears last but precedes 0. 
The positions of digits 2 and 8 are flexible. 
Given this pattern, the shortest possible sequence is 73162890.
